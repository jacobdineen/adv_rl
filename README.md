For dev work:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

# docker
This is setup to run with devcontainers. Upon opening the window with this folder, you should get prompted to launch with devcontainers.
Click ok and the image build will start (takes a while on the first build). Once that completes, you will be attached to the docker container.
Dev workflow is the same as if you were coding locally. Make sure to push your changes to a branch before killing though, as it is ephemeral.
