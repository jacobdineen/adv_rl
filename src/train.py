This is where we train the RL component
bandits should live in agent.py and be imported here
Sample output that seems like a pretty good idea for this - missing the training loop, but logic seems fine for Egreedy bandit

A common approach would be to use an epsilon-greedy strategy on top of a Q-network. I'll sketch out a quick implementation using PyTorch:

python

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
import random

class QNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_shape, output_dim):
        super(QNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(np.prod(input_shape), 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = nn.functional.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = nn.functional.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)

input_shape = env.observation_space.shape
n_actions = env.action_space.n

q_net = QNetwork(input_shape, n_actions)
optimizer = optim.Adam(q_net.parameters(), lr=0.001)

epsilon = 0.1

def policy(state):
    if random.random() < epsilon:
        return env.action_space.sample()
    else:
        with torch.no_grad():
            state = torch.FloatTensor(state).unsqueeze(0)
            q_values = q_net(state)
        return q_values.max(1)[1].item()

In this code snippet, QNetwork is a simple neural network that takes the state (flattened image) as input and outputs Q-values for each action (pixel to perturb). The policy function then either takes a random action with probability epsilon or the action that currently has the highest Q-value according to q_net.

To train the Q-network, you'd collect (state, action, reward, next_state) tuples and update the network's weights to better predict the Q-values. You might use experience replay and potentially other enhancements like target networks for more stable training.

This should be integrated into your main training loop where you would update the Q-network based on the rewards received from the environment.
